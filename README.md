# 16-bit Computer in Verilog
# Instruction Set Architecture

# Explanation of design
This processor handles instructions that are 16 bit in lengths. This was chosen to allow for flexibility in creating an RISC-based processor that was inspired by MIPS. The Data Width of the ALU is also 16 bits in length, allowing the processor to be considered 16 bit.
